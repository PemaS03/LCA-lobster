## Introduction

There are very few studies conducted on the environmental impact of commercial lobster fishing. This study compares the life cycle assessment (LCA) of American lobster (*Homarus americanus*) fisheries in Maine, for the calendar year 2006,  and southwestern Nova Scotia, during the 2005-2006 fishing season. The potential influences of different policy and management systems on the two fisheries during the specified time periods is discussed. 

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
